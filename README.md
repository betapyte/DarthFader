# Darth LED Fading Library for Arduino

This library is an evolution of the [arduino-LEDFader](https://github.com/jgillick/arduino-LEDFader) (or a regress, that depends on your point of view).

The goal was to use the simple interface of LEDFader while controlling the LEDs with the p9813 LED Driver instead of PWM.

## Dependencies
