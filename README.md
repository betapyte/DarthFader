Darth LED Fading Library for Arduino
====================================

This library is an evolution of the [arduino-LEDFader](https://github.com/jgillick/arduino-LEDFader) (or a regress, that depends on your point of view).

The goal was to use the simple interface of LEDFader while controlling the LEDs with the p9813 LED Driver instead of PWM. The [LED Strip Driver library](http://seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_LED_Strip_Driver) is used to interface with the hardware.
